# Attack Practice Exercises

This a school project for [this](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/your-project-infrastructure-project-pro4tf023-3007/) course.

This project's goal is to create easy to read and use guide for how to get started in penetration testing. There are ready made excrcises for penetration testing methods available online from different providers, but getting the exercises to work and setting up the enviroments on your computer might be difficult. In the following table you can find guides for setting up the environments for the the specific exercises and completing them. These guides are made so that even beginners can follow them and get started in their hacking career.

___Warning!___ _Remember to make sure you only scan and attack machines and IP-addresses that you own, and that are on your own system. If you are not sure if you are allowed to do something, or don't understand what a tool does, don't do it. It's illegal to probe systems you don't own, and getting caught (you will be) will burn any chances to work in the field. Other punishments depends on the law but it can be severe, including taking your freedom and crippling your finances._
