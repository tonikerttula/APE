# A1 Injection

This page will tell you how to get set up these excercises and (how to complete them (maybe?)). The following results are achieved while working on Kali Linux installed using [this guide](https://github.com/tonikerttula/APE/blob/main/Kali.md) and WebGoat installed using [this guide.](https://github.com/tonikerttula/APE/blob/main/webgoat.md)


### Intro
Tested, all excercises are working without problems. They are just waiting to be solved.

### Advanced
Tested, excercises 3 and 6 are working without problems. They are just waiting to be solved. Excersise n.5 needs a little more checking for multiple completion methods.

### Mitigation
Tested excersises 5 and 6, they are working without problems. I couldn't solve excercise 10 yet, so I haven't tested it.
