# Attack Practice Excercises

What is penetration testing? Well, it's the process of trying to break into (penetrate) machines, systems or networks. It is a useful skill with which you can simulate real attacks to, for example, workstation computers or websites to try to better the protections for these systems.

Wiggling your way around defences and exploiting vulnerabilities can be fun, engaging and rewarding. Getting your skills to the level of professional hacker however, will require practice and studying, and starting your journey can be daunting. It requires decent technical understanding and problem solving skills, as well as patience and a lot of Googling. Luckily for you, I have created this page for you to easily get started on your journey! The excercises are beginner friendly, and I have written up guides on how to get everything set up and started.

### __Ready to start attacking?__ Move to [this](https://github.com/tonikerttula/APE/blob/main/installs/Kali.md) page to set up your Virtual Machine and Kali Linux, and then click [here](https://github.com/tonikerttula/APE/blob/main/matrix.md) to start choosing the excercises! 

___Warning!___ _Remember to make sure you only scan and attack machines and IP-addresses that you own, and that are on your own system. If you are not sure if you are allowed to do something, or don't understand what a tool does, don't do it. It's illegal to probe systems you don't own, and getting caught (you will be) will burn any chances to work in the field. Other punishments depends on the law but it can be severe, including taking your freedom and crippling your finances._
