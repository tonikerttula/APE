# Attack Practice Environments

This a school project for [this](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/your-project-infrastructure-project-pro4tf023-3007/) course.

This project's goal is to create easy to read and use guide for how to get started in penetration testing. There are ready made excercises for penetration testing methods available online from different providers, but getting the excercises to work and setting up the enviroments on your computer might be difficult. In the following table you can find guides for setting up the environments for the the specific excercises and completing them. These guides are made so that even beginners can follow them and get started in their hacking career.

Credit for the project idea goes for [Tero Karvinen](https://terokarvinen.com/).
