### Project update 5.11.2021 - 12.11.2021
Not a lot of time for the project, did guides for installing [Kali](https://github.com/tonikerttula/APE/blob/main/Kali.md) and [Webgoat](https://github.com/tonikerttula/APE/blob/main/webgoat.md), also did some troubleshooting helps for if the installations encounter problems. 
I have deadlines for creating a demonstrations of a couple of ATT&CK subtechinques for next monday, so I'll create up and report them here. I'll try to create easily aproachable material (I'm also quite a beginner) so they'll be useful for this project also. I'll also have to properly report some WebGoat excercises, so I'll have at minimum A1 (at least intro), A2, A3, and A7 here. 

### Project update from 29.10.2021 - 5.11.2021
Horrible week brain power wise, I've been sick from around sunday and sleep hasn't been there.

Switched from Debian to Kali
- I already had Kali installed and the installation reported, so it was easier starting point
- Also extremely easy and simple installation, also the distro fits the theme
- Maybe debian later

Owasp top 10 2021 -> 2017 
- webgoat 8 excercises are made for owastp top 10 2017 version, also there is nothing gained by following the 2021 version in this project

Tested if the WebGoat excercises work
- took surprising amount of time, I tried to solve them if I understood what was being tasked, otherwise used help.
- when in need of help, I used this guide as instructions (https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/wiki/(Almost)-Fully-Documented-Solution-(en)#introduction)
- troubleshooting for some excercises that don't work/couldn't solve 
- more detailed reports to be done (the reports will also include my opinions about the excercise), the point of this work was to gain a idea if the excercises are ready to be solved and what extra actions it may take from user to complete them. I made the also the architechture for all the documents ready, so all the work left here is to:
  - write proper page for the excercises
  - test the excercises I wasn't able to complete due to not understanding enough about the subject

I need to choose some provider for excercises for the ATT&CK framework subjects.
