### Project update from 29.10.2021 - 5.11.2021

Switched from Debian to Kali
- I already had Kali installed and the installation reported, so it was easier starting point
- Also extremely easy and simple installation, also the distro fits the theme
- Maybe debian later

Owasp top 10 2021 -> 2017 
- webgoat 8 excercises are made for owastp top 10 2017 version, also there is nothing gained by following the 2021 version in this project

Tested if the WebGoat excercises work
- when in need of help, i used this guide as instructions (https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/wiki/(Almost)-Fully-Documented-Solution-(en)#introduction)
- troubleshooting in progress for some excercises not working 
- more detailed reports to be done (the reports will also include my opinions about the excercise), the point of this work was to gain a idea if the excercises are ready to be solved and what extra actions it may take from user to complete them. I made the also the architechture for all the documents ready, so all the work left here is to:
  - write proper page for the excercises
  - test the excercises i wasn't able to complete due to not understanding enough about the subject

I need to choose some provider for excercises for the ATT&CK framework subjects.
