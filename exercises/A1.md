# A1 Injection

These exercises are found in WebGoat, in the (A1) Injection tab. __Remember__, _don't try the methods explained in the exercises in machines or websites you don't own, it's illegal!_

The exercises have been tested to work in Kali Linux 2021.3 installed using [this guide](https://github.com/tonikerttula/APE/blob/main/installs/Kali.md) and WebGoat 8.0.0.M26 installed using [this guide.](https://github.com/tonikerttula/APE/blob/main/installs/webgoat.md)

All exercises are working without problems (exept for Mitigation exercise 10, I couldn't solve it myself and it might not work), if the installation guides were followed properly. Solutions can be found following the link, but try yourself first before looking!
