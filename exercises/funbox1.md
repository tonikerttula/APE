# Funbox 1

Funbox is a machine, that can be downloaded from Vulnhub. It's a fine machine to practice getting initial access, and then escalating privileges. This is CTF type machine, which purpose is to find a flag file!

You can download it from here https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/funbox-1,518/

To install, in the Virtual Manager click File -> Import Appliance and select the FunBox.ova file you just downloaded. Remember to change it's network settings in Virtual Box Manager to the same network with your Kali, so choose "Host-only adapter".

Happy Hunting!
