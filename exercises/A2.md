# A2 Broken Authentication

This page will tell you how to get set up these excercises and (how to complete them (maybe?)). The following results are achieved while working on Kali Linux installed using [this guide](https://github.com/tonikerttula/APE/blob/main/Kali.md) and WebGoat installed using [this guide.](https://github.com/tonikerttula/APE/blob/main/webgoat.md)

#### Authentication Bypasses
Tested, working. Excercises are ready to be solved.

#### JWT tokens
Not tested, I need to learn a bit more before tackling these excercises.


#### Password reset
In excercise 2, there is a bug in WebWolf, that prevents access to Mailbox, and renders this excercise impossible to solve. (According to official WebGoat git: https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/wiki/(Almost)-Fully-Documented-Solution-(en)#password-reset). I also couldn't get WebWolf to work yet, so Excercise 6 is also untested.
Otherwise working as expected.

#### Secure Passwords
Tested, working. Excercises are ready to be solved.
