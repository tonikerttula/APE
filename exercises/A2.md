The exercises have been tested to work in Kali Linux 2021.3 installed using [this guide](https://github.com/tonikerttula/APE/blob/main/installs/Kali.md) and WebGoat 8.0.0.M26 installed using [this guide.](https://github.com/tonikerttula/APE/blob/main/installs/webgoat.md)

In Password reset exercise 2, there is a bug in WebWolf, that prevents access to Mailbox, and renders this exercise impossible to solve if tried to solve using WebWolf. Otherwise working as expected.

Note: The JWT Tokens exercises are hard, and I didn't have success solving them without external guide help
