The excercises have been tested to work in Kali Linux 2021.3 installed using [this guide](https://github.com/tonikerttula/APE/blob/main/installs/Kali.md) and WebGoat 8.0.0.M26 installed using [this guide.](https://github.com/tonikerttula/APE/blob/main/installs/webgoat.md)

Excercise 5 works, but excercise 12 is broken and doesn't work.
