# Persistence

After you have accessed a machine, you might want to create a way to access the machine later. The earlier method used to get into the machine might not be available later. Some methods to do this:

1. Add a root user to the target machine
2. Create a backdoor (ssh for example)

Some great reading material on the subject, https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/linux-red-team-persistence-techniques/

Creating a Web Shell with msfvenom is also a great excercise, you'll find the guide on the link above.
