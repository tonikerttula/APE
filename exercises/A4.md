# A4 XXE

This page will tell you how to get set up these excercises and (how to complete them (maybe?)). The following results are achieved while working on Kali Linux installed using [this guide](https://github.com/tonikerttula/APE/blob/main/Kali.md) and WebGoat installed using [this guide.](https://github.com/tonikerttula/APE/blob/main/webgoat.md)

#### XXE
Excercises 3 and 4 working properly.

Excercise 7 needs WebWolf, and I haven't got it to work yet so testing is pending.
