You need Metasploitable 2 for this exercise, installation guide found [here](https://github.com/tonikerttula/APE/blob/main/installs/metasploitable2installation.md)

For this exercise, you'll need to set up the Metasploitable 2 machine in the same network with your Kali Linux. You can achieve this by setting them to "Host-only adapter" in the Virtual Box Manager settings for the machines.

You can access the Damn Vulnerable Web Application by typing your Metasploitable 2 machine IP-address to URL bar, and choosing DVWA.
